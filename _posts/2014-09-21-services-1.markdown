Every day you will find the date broken down into several parts, completely written in Japanese, and you will be able to listen to the pronunciation of the whole thing. Practice repeating it or reading it out loud. Even if you have no previous knowledge of Japanese, you will soon get used to the _kanji_ (ideograms) and the words that come up most often.

For instance, can you see that button near the top of the screen with the number 30 on it? That's the year, according to the Japanese era. It is not always used, but it's something easy to understand and it's not hard to get used to it by seeing every day.
